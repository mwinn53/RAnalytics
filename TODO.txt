Aesthetics: 
  Fix time conversion (up front), byte sizes, and packet loss.

  Tilt x-axis labels 45-90 degrees.

  Graph lines (Solid for mean, dashed for median; BOLD for population, normal for sample). Include a legend if possible/

  Error checking for single-node ANOVA comparisions.

  Include summary stats for subgraph section.
  
  More efficienct calculations for the subgraph (e.g., don't redo population stats from )


[FUTURE] 
  Accumulate (e.g. save) summary results of daily analysis, then compare (hypothesis testing) additional days.

SummarySE Function

					      count sum		mean	var		sd	 sem ci
	orig_bytes
	resp_bytes
	missed_bytes

		(% drop ratio) = (sum(orig_bytes) + sum(resp_bytes)) / sum(missed_bytes)

	orig_ip_bytes
	resp_ip_bytes

	orig_pkts
	resp_pkts
	
col.summary <- summarize(data, n = length(orig_bytes), mean=mean(orig_bytes), var = var(orig_bytes), sd = sd(orig_bytes), sem = sd(orig_bytes)/sqrt(length(orig_bytes)), ci = qt(.95/2+.5, length(orig_bytes)))
